## Prerequisites:
* 💻 A computer with Docker and Docker Compose installed.
* 📁 Basic understanding of Docker and command-line interface.

## Steps:
**1. Create a Docker Compose file:**
    * Open your terminal and create a new directory for your ELK Stack setup.
    * Inside the directory, create a file named docker-compose.yml 📝.

**2. Define services:**
    * Open docker-compose.yml and define the services for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
    * Use the following configuration:

**3. Get the codes/scripts from this repo.**   

**4. Create Logstash pipeline:**
    * Create a directory named logstash-pipeline and inside it, create a file named logstash.conf 📝.

**5. Run Docker Compose:**
    * In your terminal, navigate to your project directory and run docker-compose up -d 🐳.
    * Docker Compose will pull the necessary images and start the containers

**6. Access Kibana:**
